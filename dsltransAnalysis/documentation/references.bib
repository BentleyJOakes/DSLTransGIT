    abstract = {{Our growing dependence on increasingly complex computer and software systems
necessitates the development of formalisms, techniques, and tools for
assessing functional properties of these systems. One such technique that has
emerged in the last twenty years is model checking, which systematically (and
automatically) checks whether a model of a given system satisfies a desired
property such as deadlock freedom, invariants, or request-response properties.
This automated technique for verification and debugging has developed into a
mature and widely used approach with many applications. \_Principles of Model
Checking\_ offers a comprehensive introduction to model checking that is not
only a text suitable for classroom use but also a valuable reference for
researchers and practitioners in the field.


The book begins with the basic principles for modeling concurrent and
communicating systems, introduces different classes of properties (including
safety and liveness), presents the notion of fairness, and provides automata-
based algorithms for these properties. It introduces the temporal logics LTL
and CTL, compares them, and covers algorithms for verifying these logics,
discussing real-time systems as well as systems subject to random phenomena.
Separate chapters treat such efficiency-improving techniques as abstraction
and symbolic manipulation. The book includes an extensive set of examples
(most of which run through several chapters) and a complete set of basic
results accompanied by detailed proofs. Each chapter concludes with a summary,
bibliographic notes, and an extensive list of exercises of both practical and
theoretical nature.}},

A model transformation automates the translation of models between a source and a target language. In order to reason about the correctness of the translation it is important to be able to analyse model transformations. A model transformation specification can be considered as a special kind of model and as such it can be subject to existing model analysis techniques. In this paper we present a systematic method of representing declarative model transformations in a formalism called Alloy. We demonstrate how the Alloy Analyzer can be used to conduct fully automated analysis of a model transformation specification represented in Alloy. The presented approach is explained with the help of an example model transformation in business processes.}

  abstract={UML specifications offer the advantage to describe software systems while the actual task of implementing code for them is passed to code generators that automatically produce e.g.~Java code. For safety reasons, it is necessary that the generated code is semantically equivalent to the original UML specification. 
In this paper, we present our approach to formally verify within the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover that a certain algorithm for Java code generation from UML specifications is semantically correct. This proof is part of more extensive ongoing work aiming to verify UML transformations and code generation within the Fujaba tool suite. },

	Abstract = {Model-driven engineering and model-based approaches have permeated all branches of software engineering to the point that it seems that we are using models, as Moli{\`e}re's Monsieur Jourdain was using prose, without knowing it. At the heart of modeling, there is a relation that we establish to represent something by something else. In this paper we review various definitions of models and relations between them. Then, we define a canonical set of relations that can be used to express various kinds of representation relations and we propose a graphical concrete syntax to represent these relations.  We also define a structural definition for this language in the form of a metamodel and a formal interpretation using Prolog. Hence, this paper is a contribution towards a theory of modeling.},

   abstract    = {Modelling complex concurrent systems is often difficult
                 and error-prone, in particular when new concepts coming
                 from advanced practical applications are considered.
                 These new application domains include dynamicity,
                 mobility, security, and localization dependent computing.
                 In order to fully model and prototype such systems we
                 propose to use several concepts introduced in our
                 specification language CO-OPN, like context, dynamicity,
                 mobility, subtyping and inheritance. CO-OPN (Concurrent
                 Object Oriented Petri Net) is a formal specification
                 language for modelling distributed systems; it is based
                 on coordinated algebraic Petri nets. This paper focuses
                 on the use of several basic mechanisms of CO-OPN for
                 modelling mobile systems and the generation of
                 corresponding Java code. A significant example of
                 distributors accessible through mobile devices (for
                 example, PDA with Bluetooth) is fully modelled and
                 implemented with our technique.},

	abstract = {We describe the semantics of statecharts as implemented in the current version of the RHAPSODY tool. In its original 1996 version this was among the first executable semantics for object-oriented statecharts, and many of its fundamentals have been adopted in the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Due to the special challenges of object-oriented behavior, the semantics of statecharts in RHAPSODY differs from the original semantics of statecharts in STATEMATE. Two of the main differences are: (i) in RHAPSODY, changes made in a given step are to take effect in the current step and not in the next step; (ii) in RHAPSODY, a step can take more than zero time. This paper constitutes the first description of the executable semantics of RHAPSODY, highlighting the differences from the STATEMATE semantics and making an effort to explain the issues clearly but rigorously, including the motivation for some of the design decisions taken.},

              transformations. Especially transformations of visual models can
              be naturally formulated by graph transformations, since graphs are
              well suited to describe the underlying structures of models. Based
              on a common sample model transformation, four different model
              transformation approaches are presented which all perform graph
              transformations. At first, a basic solution is presented and
              crucial points of model transformations are indicated. Subsequent
              solutions focus mainly on the indicated problems. Finally, a first
              comparison of the chosen approaches to model transformation is
              presented where the main ingredients of each approach are
              summarized. },

	Abstract = {Computer-based systems (CBS) development integrates various disciplines, such as hardware design, software engineering, and performance modeling, as well as the "base" engineering discipline in which the CBS will operate. As such, use of a "non-native" modeling language is not acceptable when performing CBS design, and rapid specification and development of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) is necessary. We advocate a UML-based metamodeling technique to DSML specification and generation. A key feature of our approach is the composition of new metamodels from existing metamodels through the use of three newly defined UML operators-equivalence, implementation inheritance, and interface inheritance. The paper describes the development of these new operators, details how they are used in metamodel composition, and presents examples of metamodel composition},

This IBM Redbook is intended for a technical readership and for developers who already have good knowledge and experience in Eclipse plug-in development. 

In this book, we examine two frameworks that are developed by the Eclipse Tools Project for use with the Eclipse Platform: the Graphical Editing Framework (GEF), and the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). We cover both the Graphical Editing Framework and the Eclipse Modeling Framework, but these frameworks can be used separately, and there is no dependency between them. 

This book provides a high level introduction to these frameworks so that Eclipse plug-in developers can consider whether the frameworks will be useful for the requirements of their particular development environment. Next, tips and techniques are provided for writing code that uses GEF and EMF. Also, a detailed example is developed to illustrate a GEF editor that uses an EMF model.},

                 high-level Petri Nets faces the so-called state-space
                 explosion problem. In the context of Petri nets
                 generated from a higher level specification, this
                 problem is particularly acute due to the inherent size
                 of the considered models. A solution is to perform a
                 symbolic analysis of the reachability graph, which
                 exploits the symmetry of a model. Well-Formed Nets (
                 WN) are a class of high-level Petri nets, developed
                 specifically to allow automatic construction of a
                 symbolic reachability graph (SRG), that represents
                 equivalence classes of states. This relies on the
                 definition by the modeler of the symmetries of the
                 model, through the definition of {"}static
                 sub-classes{"}. Since a model is self-contained, these
                 (a)symmetries are actually defined by the model itself.
                 This paper presents an algorithm capable of
                 automatically extracting the symmetries inherent to a
                 model, thus allowing its symbolic study by translating
                 it to WN. The computation starts from the assumption
                 that the model is entirely symmetric, then examines
                 each component of a net to deduce the symmetry break it
                 induces. This translation is transparent to the
                 end-user, and is implemented as a service for the
                 AMI-Net package. It is particularly adapted to models
                 containing large value domains, yielding combinatorial
                 gain in the size of the reachability graph.",

                 with formal methods for the black-box testing of
                 reusable abstract data types (ADTs). We propose to test
                 a family of software components by re-engineering a
                 formal specification from an existing Ada
                 implementation, using algebraic specifications. From
                 this well-defined basis, we generate test sets
                 automatically, by constructing an exhaustive set of
                 formulae that prove the property preservations of a
                 program with respect to its specifications, and by
                 reducing this set to a finite size by applying
                 reduction hypotheses. Once the selection of a finite
                 test set has been performed, we show how to build the
                 oracle, the decision procedure for the success or the
                 failure of a test set. Finally, we discuss the
                 advantages of test sets generated from the formal
                 specification over those defined by a programmer, based
                 on his intuitive understanding of the behavior of the
                 ADT. (for the slides, see

          specification language and describe the features of
          each tool provided in the SANDS/1.5 (Structured
          Algebraic Net Development System) development
          environment.  The CO-OPN/1.5 language is a
          specification language devised to support the
          development of large concurrent systems.  The
          underlying formalisms of the language are algebraic
          specifications and Petri nets in which tokens
          correspond to algebraic values.  Furthermore, in
          order to deal with large specifications, some
          structuring principles have been introduced and in
          particular, object-orientation paradigm has been
          adopted for the Petri nets.  This means that a
          CO-OPN/1.5 specification is a collection of objects
          which interact concurrently. Interaction between the
          objects is achieved by means of synchronization
          expressions which allow the designer to select the
          object interaction policies.  The development system

          extends the {CO-OPN} (Concurrent Object Oriented Petri
          Nets) formalism, destined to support the development
          of large heterogenous distributed systems. The
          development of distributed applications has recently
          been the subject of intensive research, due to
          potential benefits that can be expected to offer in
          increasing reliability and overall performance of
          computer processing. One way of improving the
          effectiveness of the distributed system construction
          is to adopt a rigorous approach for system
          development, based on structuring principles. The
          {CO-OPN/2} approach proposes a specification language,
          based on the object-oriented paradigm, which
          includes a fine description of true concurrent
          behaviors.  This hybrid approach (model and
          property-oriented) allows for a description of the
          concurrent aspects through the use of a high-level
          Petri nets formalism which includes data structures
          expressed with the algebraic abstract data types and
          a synchronization mechanism for building hierarchies
          of abstraction. This latter notion is the concept
          which is used in structuring applications.
          Interesting properties of {CO-OPN}, such as the
          progressive refinement of specifications, allow for
          the building of systems in an incremental manner.In
          this article, we introduce CO-OPN/2 informally, by
          means of a typical example of distributed systems,
          the transit node, in order to introduce each useful
          and innovative mechanism of the language. Then , in
          the context of distributed software engineering with
          CO-OPN/2, we present our current works done in order
          to provide formal methods for several steps of a
          life cycle model test, prototyping, analysis,

          adapted to the specification of complex concurrent
          systems because it inherits the advantages of
          algebraic specifications for the specification of

          partially ordered events and from the

          paper explains the major principles for the
          specification of groupware systems with
          CO-OPN/2. This is done by mapping groupware concepts
          into CO-OPN/2 concepts and is demonstrated by means

        ABSTRACT        = {This paper describes the techniques and tools
               developed to support the construction of CO-OPN
                specifications (Concurrent Object Oriented 
                Petri Nets) [7] and the kind of semantics that
                are needed for each part of the 
                environment. CO-OPN is a specification
                language which permits an abstract 
                description of aspects of concurrent
                operations and data-structures of 
                computer programs. The concurrent and
                operational part of the formalism is 
                described by means of Petri nets, while the
                data-structures are described by 
                means of algebraic abstract data types. In the
                CO-OPN formalism, these 
                associations are structured with the notion
                of objects. CO-OPN specifications 
                can be developed, analyzed and simulated in a
                dedicated environment called 
                SANDS (Structured Algebraic Nets Development
                System [6]). Various semantics of 
                CO-OPN are exploited: an abstract operational
                semantics is used for the logic 
                programming simulator as well as for the test
                set generation tool, while a 
                more concrete operational semantics based on
                transactions is necessary for 
                prototyping on distributed systems. All these
                semantics are valid and 
                partially complete on a subpart of the CO-OPN
                language with respect to its 
                denotational semantics.}

            Coordinated Atomic Actions (CAAs) as a
            design concept and, on the other hand it
            explains how the formal language CO-OPN/2 can be used
            to express a CAA design. A real distributed application
            is developed according to a simple
            development life cycle: informal requirements,
            specification, design, implementation. The design
            phase is built according to the
            CAA concept.  The CO-OPN/2 language is used to express
            the specification, and design phase. The
            implementation is made in Java based on a library of
            generic classes adapted to CAA concepts.
            The validation phase is shortly addressed, it just
            shows to what extend the development methodology
            followed in this paper can be
            useful for proving properties."

        ABSTRACT           = {This thesis presents a new incremental prototyping 
                methodology for formally specified distributed
                systems. The objective of this methodology is
                to fill the gap which currently 
                exists between the phase where a specification 
                is simulated, generally using some sequential 
                logical inference tool, and the phase where
                the modeled system has a reliable, efficient
                and  maintainable distributed implementation
                in a main-stream object-oriented programming
                language. This  objective is realized by
                application of a methodology we call Mixed
                Prototyping with  Object-Orientation (in short, 
                OOMP). This is an extension of an existing
                approach, namely Mixed  Prototyping, that we
                have adapted to the object-oriented paradigm,
                of which we exploit the flexibility and
                inherent capability of modeling abstract
                entities.\\ 
                The OOMP process proceeds as follows. First,
                the source specifications are  automatically
                translated into a class-based object-oriented
                language, thus providing a  portable and
                high-level initial implementation. The
                generated class hierarchy is designed so that
                the  developer may independently derive new
                sub-classes in order to make the prototype
                more  efficient or to add functionalities that
                could not be specified with the given formalism.
                This  prototyping process is performed
                incrementally in order to safely validate the
                modifications against  the semantics of the
                specification. The resulting prototype can
                finally be considered as the end-user 
                implementation of the specified software. \\
                The originality of our approach is that we
                exploit object-oriented programming  techniques 
                in the implementation of formal specifications
                in order to gain flexibility in the development
                process. Simultaneously, the object paradigm
                gives the means to harness this newly 
                acquired freedom by allowing automatic
                generation of test routines which verify the
                conformance of  the hand-written code with
                respect to the specifications. \\
                We demonstrate the generality of our
                prototyping scheme by applying it to a 
                distributed collaborative diary program within
                the frame of CO-OPN (Concurrent Object-Oriented 
                Petri Nets), a very powerful specification
                formalism which allows expressing 
                concurrent and non-deterministic behaviours,
                and which provides structuring facilities such
                as  modularity, encapsulation and genericity. \\
                An important effort has also been accomplished
                in the development or adaptation of distributed
                algorithms for cooperative symbolic resolution. 
                These algorithms are used in the run-time
                support of the generated prototypes. }
